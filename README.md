TPW Settings
======

This small program should provide an easy and efficient graphical interface to configure the TPW MODS package, that has proven essential for a thorough enjoyement of [ArmA III](http://www.arma3.com/).

Everything is coded in Java, and simply acts as a graphical version of the TPW_CONFIG.hpp file that tpw himself has already set up to configure his mod package.

Usage
======

- Main window will have a button for each available mod in the package
- Multiple presets will be savable and loadable
- Clicking on one of the buttons will open a second mod related window
  - HUD mod will have a live preview of the HUD itself, updating at every change
  - Tooltips will show the description of every parameter
  - Parameters will be modifiable by editing
    - Number fields
    - Text fields
    - Checkboxes
